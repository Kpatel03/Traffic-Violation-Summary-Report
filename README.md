# Traffic-Violation-Summary-Report

### Overview

This project presents a Traffic Violation Summary Report built in Tableau, analyzing violation patterns, driver behavior, fine collection, and regional trends. The dashboard highlights key issues in traffic compliance and provides insights for policy-making, enforcement, and awareness campaigns.

### Key Highlights

- **Violation Behavior:** Wrong Parking & Drunk Driving are leading offenses; low compliance with helmets/seatbelts.

- **Fine Collection:** Less than half of total fines are paid; significant share diverted to court cases.

- **Payment Method:** Cash remains the most common, though digital payments are growing.

- **Regional Trends:** Specific hotspots record more violations, requiring targeted action.

- **Monthly Trends:** Violations are steady across months ‚Üí no seasonal spikes.

### Data Cleaning & Preparation

- To ensure accurate analysis, the dataset was cleaned and standardized:

- Removed duplicate Violation IDs.

- Standardized violation type names (e.g., ‚ÄúNo Helmet‚Äù vs. ‚ÄúHelmet Not Worn‚Äù).

- Handled missing values (e.g., Helmet/Seatbelt ‚Üí marked as N/A).

- Aggregated monthly totals for trend analysis.

- Create calculated fields

### Objective
